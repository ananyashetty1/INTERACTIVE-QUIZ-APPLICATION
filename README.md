DESCRIPTION :
     s part of my internship with CODTECH, I was assigned Task-1, which involved building a Quiz Application using JavaScript. The objective of this task was to develop an interactive and user-friendly quiz system where users can attempt multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback on their answers, and view their final score once the quiz is completed. This task provided me with hands-on experience in web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, styling with CSS, and logic building in JavaScript.

The quiz application consists of three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structural layout of the quiz, including placeholders for the question text, options, feedback messages, navigation buttons, and a progress bar. The CSS is responsible for the design and user interface, making the quiz visually appealing, responsive, and easy to navigate. The JavaScript forms the logical core of the application by dynamically displaying questions, validating answers, providing real-time feedback, and calculating the final score.

The application begins with a predefined question bank stored in an array of objects in JavaScript. Each object contains a question, multiple options, and the correct answer index. When the quiz starts, the first question is rendered on the screen, and the options are displayed as clickable buttons. As soon as the user selects an option, the application immediately evaluates the response. If the selected answer is correct, the option is highlighted in green and a "Correct ✅" message appears. If the answer is incorrect, the selected option turns red, while the correct answer is highlighted for clarity. This approach ensures that the user receives instant feedback, which is a key requirement of the task.

Once the feedback is shown, the Next button becomes active, allowing the user to proceed to the following question. A progress bar and progress text at the top indicate the current status of the quiz, helping users track how many questions they have completed. After the last question, the quiz displays a summary screen with the user’s total score and a motivational message based on their performance. For example, a perfect score is rewarded with a congratulatory message, while an average performance encourages the user to keep practicing. Additionally, a Restart button is provided so that users can retake the quiz from the beginning.

From a learning perspective, this task helped me understand several important concepts of web development:

Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML tags.

Applying CSS styling to improve usability and aesthetics.

Using JavaScript functions, event listeners, and arrays to manage dynamic content.

Implementing user feedback mechanisms for better interactivity.

Enhancing the user experience through features like a progress bar and restart option.

Overall, building this quiz application was an excellent opportunity to practice full-stack front-end development. It enhanced my ability to design interactive web applications, strengthened my logical thinking for handling user input, and improved my coding efficiency in JavaScript. The successful completion of this task also prepared me for larger projects where real-time user interaction and instant feedback are essential.
